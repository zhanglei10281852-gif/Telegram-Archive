          stored (``photo``, ``voice``, ``geo``, ``contact`` ...) or ``message``

        caller's path (``listener`` or ``sync``) on the version it writes.

        An edit writes the version it supersedes first: the old text, its
        formatting (entities and block tree) and its date. With

        so an edit that rewrote a Rich Text Editor message never leaves the
        old tree beside the new text.

        ``media_changed`` says the same edit replaced the message's photo or
        file (``reconcile_media_row`` kept the old one): it is an edit even when

        * ``deleted`` — soft-deleted messages (``is_deleted=1``), dated by

        * ``edited`` — ``message_versions`` rows, dated by ``captured_at``
          (when the archive observed the supersession), carrying the old text
          plus the message's CURRENT text.
        * ``transcript`` — finished voice transcripts, dated by
          ``completed_at``, carrying the transcript text and its language, so
          a poller sees new transcripts (docs/TRANSCRIPTION.md). Left out
          when ``with_transcripts`` is False, for a no-download login.
        * ``reaction`` — a reaction taken back: a ``reaction_history`` row
          whose count is below the one before it, dated by ``observed_at``,
          carrying the emoji, how many went (``count``), ``count_before``,
          ``count_after`` and the message's current text. Only when
          ``with_reactions`` is True: reactions come and go far more often
          than the rest, and the viewer asks for them only when the reader
          ticks the kind.

        Newest first. ``before`` is an exclusive keyset cursor over the
        per-row date: pass the last row's ``date`` back to page. Rows sharing
        that exact microsecond with the cursor are skipped — this is a review
        feed, not an export, and the export path is the lossless one.
        Entitlements ride ``scope.sql_predicates()`` against the joined chat

        feed touches only their rows. Hard deletions cannot appear: their
        content no longer exists (DELETION_MODE=soft is what feeds this).

        ``chat_id`` with ``account_id`` narrows the feed to the chat a ref
        names. For a channel or a group that is the chat itself, every copy the
        scope allows: an event exists only in the copy whose listener was up
        when it happened, so narrowing to the ref's own copy would drop the
        events only another account captured, which the feed of every chat
        lists. Each event is still listed once, under the lowest entitled copy
        that holds it. A ref to a private chat narrows to the ref's own
        account, since its id is the other party's user id and names a
        different conversation in each account, whatever type another
        account's copy of that id carries. It narrows, never widens: ``scope``
        still applies, and the caller resolves the ref under the same scope
        first.

        Get paginated media records for a chat with cursor-based pagination.

        A cursor may be given either as a storage id (``before_id``/``after_id``)
        or as the natural key ``(message_id, type)`` (``before_key``/``after_key``).
        The gallery URL carries the natural key, because an imported row's
        storage id is not derivable from it (#423) — resolving the cursor by
        column keeps 'load more' working on archives built from an import
        instead of dead-ending at the first imported item.

        ``account_id=None`` is unscoped until phase 4. The media↔message joins
        below carry the account equality UNCONDITIONALLY: a ``{chat}_{msg}_{type}``
        media id repeats across accounts, so joining without it would multiply
        rows even for a caller that asked for no scoping.

        ``before_id``/``after_id`` are opaque ``Media.id`` tokens (the gallery
        round-trips the composite ``{chat}_{msg}_{type}`` string), but each is resolved
        to the pair (Media.message_id, Media.id) before use. ``Media.id`` alone sorts
        lexically, so rows sharing a message came back as 9, 99, 98, ..., 8, 89 —
        numerically meaningless; ``Media.message_id`` is an integer and orders
        correctly. Ordering on the media pair rather than on ``Message.date`` is what
        lets one covering index (``idx_media_gallery``) serve filter, cursor predicate
        and ORDER BY in a single seek: per-chat Telegram message ids are assigned
        monotonically in time (the same fact the message ``before_id`` cursor relies
        on), so the pair yields the identical chronological order without dragging
        the messages join into the sort.

        Two directions, one cursor shape:

        - ``before_id`` walks BACKWARD (older): predicate ``<`` on the triple, ordered
          DESC, page returned newest-first. ``has_more`` means "more OLDER rows exist".
        - ``after_id`` walks FORWARD (newer): predicate ``>`` on the triple, ordered
          ASC, page returned oldest-first. ``has_more`` means "more NEWER rows exist".
          The audio queue uses this to extend forward on demand instead of
          pre-collecting every item newer than the playing track (#266).

        The two are MUTUALLY EXCLUSIVE: supplying both is a caller bug (there is no
        coherent page "before X and after Y" in this API) and raises ``ValueError``.

        The ORDER BY and the cursor predicate MUST stay the same pair, in the same
        direction: that identity is what guarantees a full walk yields every row
        exactly once (no skips, no duplicates). Change one and you must change the
        other — in both directions.

        The cursor resolution is scoped to ``chat_id``, forward as well as backward.
        Unscoped, a caller could pass ANOTHER chat's media id and have that row's
        timestamp shape this chat's result window — a cross-chat existence/timestamp
        oracle for a chat the caller cannot read. A token that does not belong to
        ``chat_id`` is indistinguishable from a deleted one and returns an EMPTY page
        (never a full first page) in either direction, so neither the existence nor the
        date of a foreign row can be inferred from the response, and a client can treat
        both directions alike.

        re-key the row whichever type each side computed. Reconstructing the
        sweep spelling and querying by it therefore finds nothing for an
        imported row, which is #423.

        So this asks for what the caller actually means, using the columns
        that hold it. Being predicate-scoped rather than string-scoped also
        makes the chat bound explicit: ``get_media_by_id`` is account-scoped
        only, so a chat bound smuggled inside an id string is a bound only for
        as long as every caller keeps minting that string itself.

        Ordered like ``get_messages`` attaches media (downloaded first, then
        lowest id) so the bytes this serves are the bytes the message payload
        described, even where a re-download left a duplicate row behind.

        """The media row this message already has, re-typed to the current
        judgement, or None when the message has no media row yet.

        ``telegram_file_id`` is the id of the photo or document the message
        carries now (``media_file_id``). When the row holds a different known
        id and the read shows an edit that can have made the change, the
        media was replaced: the row is kept as a ``media_versions`` row and
        comes back empty under a new id, with ``"replaced": True``, so the
        caller downloads the new file into it (``_replace_media_row``).
        ``source`` names the caller's path on the versions that writes, and
        ``edit_date`` and ``edit_hide`` are the edit date and Telegram's
        hidden-edit flag of the message the caller read.

        When the row holds another file by its recorded ``telegram_file_id``
        and was not replaced (the read shows no such edit), or the row could
        not be kept, it comes back with ``"superseded": True``: it holds other
        media than the caller's, and the caller must not download into it. An
        id read from an old file name is a guess: it can start a replacement
        when the read shows an edit, and never makes a row superseded.

        A link preview's photo or document is not compared when the row holds
        a link preview too: Telegram crawls the page again and can serve
        another preview photo for a message nobody edited
        (``_is_preview_refresh``).

        ``Media.id`` used to be minted fresh on every capture from
        ``{chat}_{msg}_{type}`` -- so it cached a JUDGEMENT (what kind of thing
        this media is) and then that string was used as the row's identity. The
        moment the judgement changed, the writer stopped talking about the row
        it already had: a re-processed round video reclassified from ``video``
        to ``video_note`` became a SECOND row, the original stayed
        ``downloaded=0`` with its attempt counter untouched, and the pending
        retry re-requested it from Telegram every cycle without ever reaching
        the attempt cap.

        So the id stops being identity. A message's media row is found by its
        ``(account_id, chat_id, message_id)`` COLUMNS and keeps whatever id it
        was first filed under: opaque and stable. A reclassification never
        re-keys it; only a replacement does, and then the old id stays with
        the old media in ``media_versions``. Nothing reads its shape any more:
        the viewer builds URL keys from the message and type columns, and
        ``get_media_for_message`` looks rows up the same way. Only ``type`` is
        corrected, which is the value every reader actually consults.

        Ordered exactly like ``get_media_for_message`` (downloaded first, then
        lowest id) so the writer and the reader always agree on which row is
        canonical when an archive holds more than one for a message.

        ``observed`` is the complete current per-emoji aggregate
        (``[{"emoji", "count"}]``, ``count`` authoritative) — the same shape the
        scheduled backup and the live UpdateMessageReactions handler both produce.
        Storage is intentionally EMOJI-AGGREGATE ONLY (one row per (message, chat,
        emoji), ``user_id`` NULL): per-user attribution is unsound on a user client
        (Telegram exposes only a tiny ``recent_reactions`` preview, so a reactor
        rolling off it is indistinguishable from a removal), so we never persist or
        rely on it. Unlike the legacy full delete-then-reinsert, this:

        - preserves ``created_at`` on the surviving row (first-seen survives
          re-scans — the reporter's histogram measured backup cadence precisely
          because the old path reset it every run);
        - keeps exactly one row per emoji via UPDATE, never ON CONFLICT (the
          ``uq_reaction`` constraint's nullable ``user_id`` is non-colliding in SQL,
          so an upsert on it would grow unbounded) — and collapses any legacy
          multi-row-per-emoji rows into that single aggregate;
        - reconciles removals INCLUDING to zero: an emoji absent from ``observed``
          is tombstoned (``removed_at``) when ``mark_removed`` (default), else
          deleted — this branch runs even when ``observed`` is empty;
        - is a no-op when the message is not archived (best-effort; never stubs a
          synthetic message row, which would render blank in the viewer and, with
          the FK having no CASCADE, raise on PostgreSQL);
        - adds a ``reaction_history`` row for every emoji whose count differs
          from the newest row kept for it (0 when it went), tagged with
          ``source``, so a count that drops without reaching zero and an emoji
          that comes back both keep their earlier state. An emoji with a
          ``reactions`` row and no history first gets the baseline that row
          stands for (``_reaction_baseline``), the same one migration 037 seeds.

        one list and another way in the next (#259 was exactly that drift).

        Null contract: a message that IS a reply always carries both
        ``reply_to_sender_name`` and ``reply_to_media_type``. They are None when
        the target is not in the archive (never captured, hard-deleted, or in

        viewer renders its own fallback. A soft-deleted target is still archived
        history and resolves normally. A message that is not a reply carries
        neither key. ``reply_to_text`` is only backfilled when the row did not
        capture one.

        post-filter drops substring hits ('#tag' inside '#taglonger').
        Entitlements arrive as ``scope`` and apply in the WHERE clause exactly
        like the chat list, so a restricted viewer's tag search can only ever

        list's folding rule to the cross-chat tabs only — see the call site
        below. Offset paging re-scans from the
        top by design — tag result sets are small, and each request bounds its
        own scan (``scan_cap`` prefilter rows) so no single call can walk the
        table. When the cap truncates the scan, ``has_more`` stays False —
        pages past the cap are unreachable through an offset API, and
        advertising them would loop the client forever — and ``truncated``
        turns True so the UI can say the search was cut short.

    # PostgreSQL has two ways to answer "the newest N messages matching q", and
    # its planner cannot tell which one is right: the tsquery is built inside
    # the database (PG_TSQUERY_FROM_SEARCH) and prefix terms get a flat row
    # estimate either way, so it always walks idx_messages_date backwards and
    # filters. That is 1 ms for a dense term and a full-table walk for a rare
    # or absent one — 2 to 9 s on a large archive. The GIN index is the
    # opposite: its cost is the number of hits, so a rare term is milliseconds
    # and a single letter is over a second. So the search first asks the index
    # how many hits there are, capped, and takes the path that is bounded for
    # that answer: under GLOBAL_SEARCH_DENSE_HITS the hit set is materialised
    # and sorted; at or above it the walk fills a page within a few thousand
    # rows. The walk keeps a statement timeout for the one shape neither path
    # bounds — a dense term whose newest hit is millions of rows back — and
    # the sorted hit set answers when it fires. SQLite's FTS5 always drives
    # from the hit set, and sorting the keys before the joins is what keeps a
    # common word cheap there (measured on a mid-sized archive: 87 ms against
    # 667 ms for the joined walk), so SQLite takes that one path

        Entitlements arrive as ``scope`` and apply in SQL exactly like the chat
        list and the tag view, so a restricted viewer's search only ever
        touches entitled chats. Matching is word-prefix through the same
        predicate as the per-chat search (``_text_search_predicate``). Unlike
        the per-chat search there is no ILIKE fallback: without the full-text
        layer a cross-chat substring scan reads the whole archive per
        keystroke, so the answer is empty with ``indexed`` False and the
        viewer says the index is missing. A search carrying no word at all
        (punctuation, emoji) answers empty too.

        Rows carry ``chat_ref``/``chat_title``/``chat_first_name``/
        ``chat_last_name``/``chat_username``/``chat_type``/``chat_is_forum``
        so the viewer names the chat the way the chat list does (a private
        chat has no title), ``topic_title`` for forum hits, and ``is_deleted``
        so a soft-deleted hit can be dimmed like it is in the chat.

        ``fold_shared`` applies the chat list's folding rule, so a channel two
        accounts both archive answers once, through the copy the chat list
        shows — which is also the only ``chat_ref`` whose row the sidebar has,
        so a hit always opens a chat the reader can see. Private chats are
        never folded, there or here.

        ``dense_hits`` and ``walk_timeout_ms`` exist for tests that want to
        drive each PostgreSQL path with a handful of rows.

        Voice transcripts are searched too (docs/TRANSCRIPTION.md): the hit
        set is the UNION of two indexed key sets, message keys from the
        messages index and message keys reached from transcript hits through
        ``media`` on ``(account_id, media_id)``. Never an OR or an EXISTS in
        the message predicate, which would turn every page into a scan. Each
        row's ``matched_in`` is ``transcript`` when only the transcript side
        produced its key, else ``message``. Without the transcript search
        objects (SQLite without FTS5, or a database not yet at 032), or with
        ``with_transcripts`` False (a no-download login), the transcript side
        is absent.

        extra row is fetched to answer ``has_more``.

                (or, without before_date, an id-only bound: rows with id < before_id)
            after_id: Cursor - get messages newer than this message ID (takes
                precedence over the other cursors; used for jump-to-message
                after-context). Response stays newest-first like every other mode.
            topic_id: Optional forum topic ID to filter messages by thread
            deleted_only: Keep only the rows deleted in Telegram that the
                archive kept (``is_deleted=1``). Combines with every other
                filter and cursor; a read-only narrowing of the same query.
            edited_only: Keep only the edited rows (``_edited_predicate``):
                ``edit_date`` set, or an earlier version kept. Combines like
                ``deleted_only``.

            List of message dictionaries with user and media info. A row that is a
            reply also carries ``reply_to_sender_name`` and ``reply_to_media_type``
            (both nullable) so the viewer can render "Reply to <name>" (#268).
            Every row carries ``reactions`` (live, per emoji) and
            ``removed_reactions``: the emojis taken back, each with the count it
            had and ``removed_at``, when the archive noticed, newest first.

        """The drain query: downloaded media of ``types`` that still needs a transcript.

        ``types`` follows the rule of ``is_transcribable`` in
        transcription_contract: a name outside ``TRANSCRIBABLE_TYPES`` is
        ignored, and a ``document`` qualifies only with an audio or video
        ``mime_type``.

        A media qualifies when its newest transcript row is missing, or is
        ``queued`` with no ``job_id`` and older than ``stale_before`` (a
        process died between the insert and the submit; the row is reused),
        or is ``failed`` under the retry rule below. A ``done`` or ``skipped``
        newest row ends the loop for that media.

        The retry rule reads each failed row's reason, so rows written before
        it follow it too. A failure about the file's content or the request
        counts: three of them end the retries. A failure whose ``content_hash``
        (or ``idempotency_key``, the file's sha256 when the media had no hash)
        differs from the media's current hash was about earlier bytes (a file
        cut short and downloaded again since) and does not count. A failure in
        ``TRANSCRIPT_ENVIRONMENT_ERRORS`` does not count, since a repair of
        the disk or the server makes it go away. A file failure (missing,
        unreadable) qualifies on every drain; ``transcribe_media`` writes
        nothing while the file is still missing or unreadable, so such media
        come from a query of their own, at most ``per_run`` of them, each
        after the other media of its priority tier, and take no place in
        the budget: the drain stops once ``per_run`` media did more than
        that check. A server failure qualifies once the
        server finished a transcript of its own (not a copy) after it. With
        none since, the server may still be broken, and one such media per
        drain goes as a probe, from a query of its own: the first in
        priority order, longest waiting first, whose wait is over: none
        after its first failed row, then ``TRANSCRIPT_PROBE_WAIT`` after
        the second, doubled for each failed row after that. Ten
        failed rows of any reason end the retries, which stops a file the
        server keeps failing on while it finishes others.

        A media with no row of its own qualifies even when its account
        already holds a ``done`` transcript of the same audio: the drain's
        copy rule (``find_copyable_transcript``) then copies that answer when
        it matches the current server, preset and diarization, and sends the
        file when it does not. The viewer still shows a twin's row on it
        until then.

        A ``queued`` row with no ``job_id`` and no ``preset`` is a user's
        ask-now from the viewer, which never knows the preset: the backup
        fills it when it picks the row up. Such a row qualifies at once,
        whatever its type (the viewer does not know ``types`` and refuses
        types no server transcribes), and sorts first, so the next drain
        sends it first. Once picked up it carries a preset, and the same
        query takes it back after ten minutes if it is still ``queued`` with
        no ``job_id`` (a refusal, an outage or a crash mid-submit), whatever
        its type: the type filter of the main query would otherwise strand
        a pressed file of a type outside ``types`` for good. Then newest download
        first, at most ``per_run`` rows besides the file checks. Each result
        carries the media columns and ``transcript``: the newest row's id,
        status, job_id and error, or None.

        The ask-now rows are read by a query of their own, from the few
        open transcript rows. OR-ing them into the type filter of the main
        query would keep PostgreSQL off ``idx_media_type`` and read every
        media row of every type on each drain.

        ``priority_chat_ids`` (TRANSCRIPTION_PRIORITY_CHAT_IDS) orders the
        main query only: media of those chats first, in list order, then
        the rest, and the probe. It never widens what qualifies, and the
        ask-now rows still come before all of it.
