"""Merge one archive into another: ``telegram-archive merge``.

The source archive is only read. Each of its accounts is added to the target
under the next free account id, every row the account owns is copied under
that id, and the media files those rows point at are copied into the target's
media folder. Nothing already in the target is deleted or changed.

Two archives at the same head revision are required: the table list below is
the schema at head, and a source at another revision would be missing columns
or carry columns this code does not know.

Custom emoji (``custom_emoji`` and the files in ``media/_emoji``) are shared by
every account, so the rows and files the target lacks are added and the
target's own stay as they are. A row whose file does not come across arrives
pending, and the target's next backup fetches it.

What is not merged, on purpose: viewer accounts, viewer sessions, share
tokens, push subscriptions, the viewer audit log and app settings. Those
describe who may read the source install, not what it archived. Global
metadata (backup timestamps, cached statistics, the push keys) belongs to the
target install and stays as it is.

Privacy: every message this module raises or returns names tables, counts and
account row ids only, never a chat id, a path, a title or message content.
